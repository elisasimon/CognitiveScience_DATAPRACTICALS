# Data Practicals

This repositery is there to show that I am able to do some stuff with data and RStudio.
You will find data on a lot of really interesting subjects, such as chocolate, coffee, alcohol, marriage, divorce, happiness and suicide.

Here is a little list of the different data practicals: (W2) means it is the second week's practical, and so on.

+ [Swiss fertility, coffee and chocolate (W3)](https://github.com/elisasimon/CognitiveScience_DATAPRACTICALS/blob/main/W3.md)
+ [More chocolate... suicide and happiness (W4)](https://github.com/elisasimon/CognitiveScience_DATAPRACTICALS/blob/main/W4.md)
+ [For ever and ever (W5)](https://github.com/elisasimon/CognitiveScience_DATAPRACTICALS/blob/main/W5.md)
+ [Of code and coffee (W6)](https://github.com/elisasimon/CognitiveScience_DATAPRACTICALS/blob/main/W6.md)
+ [Suicide and happiness (W7)](https://github.com/elisasimon/CognitiveScience_DATAPRACTICALS/blob/main/W7.md) (spoiler: being life-satisfied does not prevent from suicide)
+ [You can probably drinks on weekdays and don't fail (W8)](https://github.com/elisasimon/CognitiveScience_DATAPRACTICALS/blob/main/W8.md)

Hope you'll have fun. I did. Sometimes.

P.S. If you need to see the R codes, here is another list:
