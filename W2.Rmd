## the great ggplot2 package

Here is how to load the ggplot2 package that is very usefull for data visualization

```{r data}
library(ggplot2)
```

## the R dataset

R has some built-in datasets. Here is how to see our options in the package 'datasets':
```{r, eval = FALSE}
data()
```

I choose the dataset 'iris' (Edgar Anderson's Iris Data). It provides data about sepal and pedal length and width of different species of flowers: the first rows are displayed below:

```{r}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```
