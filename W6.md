# Of code and coffee

This data set contains data about coffee consumption and coding habits
(source: NajElKotob (2018))

## Two questions

1.  Is there a relationship between the time spend coding and the number
    of cups of coffee ?

2.  Is there a relationship between the time spend coding and the coffee
    brand ?

## Visualization (1) : Coffee Cups and Coding Hours

Here I want to see whether there is a correlation between the variables
CodingHours and CoffeeCupsPerDay. Therefore, I used a **scatter plot**.

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
